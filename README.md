# The Nimble Thimble

My webpage is for a potential boutique sewing shop that sells custom-made
clothing and costumes.

## UX

This website is for individuals and smaller theatres looking for somewhere to get custom-made clothing and costumes.
I want it to be clear that we sew all kinds of clothing, and that people are welcome to contact us about any project they might have in mind.

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.
